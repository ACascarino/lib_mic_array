Overview
--------

This demo application shows a simple Delay and Sum (DAS) beam-former. It shows the setup of the I2S for audio 
output via the DAC and very simple processing of multi-channel audio frames to produce a single channel
output based on a simple single steering direction.

Ensure that an XTAG is connected along with the microphone array via USB. 
Headphones should be connected to the audio jack for listening to the beamformed output.
