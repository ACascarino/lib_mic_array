Overview
--------

This demo application shows a simple Delay and Sum (DAS) beam-former. It shows the setup of the I2S for audio 
output via the DAC and very simple processing of multi-channel audio frames to produce a single channel
output based on a simple single steering direction.

The simple lores delay and sum example
--------------------------------------

The example in this note uses the microphone array library and shows a simple program
that interfaces to to the PDM microphones, decimates the PDM and finally packs it into frames.

To start using the microphone array library library, you need to add ``lib_mic_array`` to
your ``Makefile``::

        USED_MODULES = ... lib_mic_array ...

You can then access the microphone array library functions in your source code via
the ``lib_mic_array.h`` header file::

	#include ""lib_mic_array.h""

Demo Hardware Setup
------------------- 

	#. Connect the xTAG-2 or xTAG-3 to Microphone array ref design v1.
	#. Connect the xTAG-2 or xTAG-3 USB connector to the USB connector on your development PC using a USB cable. 
	#. Connect the microphone array ref design v1 to your development PC using another USB cable. 
	#. Connect the microphone array ref design v1 to your headphones.

Launching the demo application
------------------------------

Once the application source code is imported into the tools you can then build the project
which will generate the binary file required to run the demo application.

Once the application has been built you need to download the application binary
code onto the xCORE microphone array ref design v1. Here you use the tools to load the application 
over JTAG onto the xCORE multicore microcontroller.

Then click **Run**.

Alternatively, from the command line build the application, by doing a call to ``xmake``, then 
run using ``xrun --xscope app_lores_DAS_fixed.xe``. Nothing will happen.
 
Buttons ``A`` and ``D`` rotate the direction of the beam which is indicated by the LEDs.
Buttons ``C`` and ``B`` increase and decrease the gain on the output signal respectively.
